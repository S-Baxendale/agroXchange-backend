# agroXchange Marketplace App - Server

For my Real world project during my time at Codaisseur Academy I worked closely with a product owner and contributed to building a responsive marketplace Application for South American farmers to connect them with buyers locally and internationally. The primary focus here was to ensure the useability for the farmers who often only have access to a mobile phone and to allow for full translation from English to Spanish.

Examples of the functionality of this app for are listed below:
___

### Buyers/Sellers: 

* EN to ES translation
* Sign Up & Login with full Authentication and Authorization.
* A dynamic marketplace, with search filters to display products currently on sale.
* To allow a seller to list their produce and upload a photo.
* To allow a seller to update their product.
* An internal chat feature to allow buyer and sellers to communicate with oneanother.
* To allow a buyer to make an offer on a product.
* Email notifcations upon signup and making an offer on a product.

### Admin: 

* To approve pending users who have signed up for the App.
* To have full access to current/expired products and deals made between sellers/buyers.

# Installation & Prerequisites
For installation & running the app best use: 
 [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) - Dependency Management

### Frontend: 
Open terminal, go to frontend folder, run "yarn install" start or "npm install" depending on your setup.
Then run "yarn start" or "npm start" This will run the app on port 3000 in your web browser. 

### Backend: 
Same as frontend, run "yarn install" for the dependencies. Afterwards run "nodemon ." in the terminal. This will start the server on port 4009.

### Database: 
I'm running a docker container (port 5432) with a Postgres DB. A local DB should work as well.
